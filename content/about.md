# About Us

Welcome to our team at [Your Company Name]!

## Meet Our Team

### Daniel T.

Daniel is a physicist, imaging scientist, and clinical radiologist with a dedicated focus on machine learning and magnetic resonance imaging. He brings a unique blend of expertise, having studied both physics and medicine at prestigious institutions like RWTH Aachen University and Imperial College, London. In 2013, he completed his MD thesis on the compatibility of positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, and since then, he has been a driving force in the field. Daniel is not just a clinician; he is a researcher at heart. He is currently the head of the interdisciplinary research group "Infinite Imaging Research," where his work is at the intersection of machine learning and clinical practice. His contributions are recognized not only through his clinical work but also as a reviewer for medical, technical, and interdisciplinary scientific journals.

### Gustav

Gustav's journey began with electrical engineering at RWTH Aachen University. During his studies, he delved into deep learning methods for breast cancer classification and later explored the intricacies of radiomics features. He joined our team in 2020 and is now a dedicated PhD candidate. His primary goal is to establish and validate deep learning methods in clinical practice. Currently, Gustav is involved in projects ranging from machine learning-based optimization strategies in breast cancer screening to joint MRI post-processing. His commitment to bridging the gap between technology and healthcare is evident in his work. 

### Firas

Firas, another valuable member of our team, is a PhD candidate specializing in applying machine learning techniques to medical image analysis. With a background in Electrical Engineering from Hamburg University of Technology and a master's degree from RWTH Aachen University, Firas is well-versed in both theory and practice. His experience includes incorporating MRI knee segmentation algorithms into the workflow of clinical radiologists, demonstrating his commitment to practical solutions in the medical field. His current projects involve automatic analysis and detection of pathologies on knee MRI studies and chest radiographs using artificial neural networks.
